# Balun_Test_Tool
KiCad Schematic and PCB of an simple test tool for Balun's and Unun's

Every time I'm building a BalUn or an UnUn for an antenna project, I like to check the performance (insertion loss, reverse isolation, VSWR,  etc) with a nanoVNA. So an adequate termination resistor is needet for this meassurement, depending on the BaLun/UnUn tranformation.

Based on an ideea from the Youtube-channel "Funkfieber" I created my own (more compact) version of thier "Balun Tester". 

It provides the termination for the most commonly used transform ratios in hamradio, that are:
1:1 - 50 Ohm
1:2 - 100 Ohm
1:4 - 200 Ohm
1:6 - 300 Ohm
1:9 - 450 Ohm
1:49 - 2450 Ohm
1:64 - 3200 Ohm

Resistors are metall oxid thin film 1/4W SMD 1206 (3216).
